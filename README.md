  AS there is no need to store the uploaded files . I have kept DB as sqlite only. Same has been uploaded also.
  
  to run the project the project download the folder or ZIP file(Post download unzip it.).
  
  Go to the project folder and find manage.py file .
  Open CMD/Powershell on that location and enter command 'python manage.py runserver'.
  
  I Have kept a very simple GUI for uploading and generating reports.
  Uploading image and XML file:
  as you run the project on homepage you can upload the xml and image file and the output image with be added on the homepage.
  FOr generating reports go to "generate reports" link and enter the "From date" and "To Date". Once enter kindly click on submit. IF the date is valid, you will get a link for the        file.
  Click and download the file.
